# ðŸ¦œ Transportflow

Transportflow is a webpage to help people use public transport conviniently in germany.<br>
[Live Demo ðŸ›°](https://transportflow.online/)

### ðŸ“š History

Transportflow evolved from being a small project which queried local transport provider api
into a fancy application which, once finished, can show trips and monitor departures all over germany.
The first version wasn't really fancy but is still available as [Public Transport Information](https://github.com/Adwirawien/PublicTransportInformation).
It was followed by a react rework and currently we're working on a svelte version of the application.<br>
Contributions are welcome ðŸ™ƒ

### ðŸš‡ Future

We just released the svelte version of our app. In the future we're planning to
release native apps. The technology is not finally selected yet but probably will be react native,
as it's supported widely with modules and has a big community.
