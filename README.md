# ðŸ¦œ Transportflow

Transportflow was a webpage to help people use public transport conviniently in germany.<br>
It is now transformed into an intelligent travel assistant.

### State of the project

Transportflow evolved from being a small project which queried local transport provider api
into a fancy application which, once finished, can show trips and monitor departures all over germany.
The first version wasn't really fancy but is still available as [Public Transport Information](https://github.com/Adwirawien/PublicTransportInformation).
It was followed by a react rework and a svelte version.<br>

As of now, I have plans to develop transportflow into an intelligent travel assistant,<br>
which will be backend independent (contrary to previous iterations) and only available as an app.
