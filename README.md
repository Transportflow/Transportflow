### ⛸ Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

#### 📦 Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)/[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

#### 💈 Installing

How to start the site on your system:

- clone the repo
- cd into it
- run `$ [npm|yarn] install` to install dependencies
- then run `$ [npm|yarn] run build-css` to build the tailwind.css file
- finally run `$ [npm|yarn] run dev` to start the development server
- visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser

Since we use next.js for the routing stuff, the page automatically reloads when you make changes during development.
