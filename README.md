# 🦜 Transportflow

Transportflow is a webpage to help people use public transport conviniently in germany.<br>
[Live Demo of the old React Version 🛰](https://transportflow.online/)<br>

### 📚 History

Transportflow evolved from being a small project which queried local transport provider api<br>
into a fancy application which, once finished, can show trips and monitor departures all over germany.<br>
The first version wasn't really fancy but is still available as [Public Transport Information](https://github.com/Adwirawien/PublicTransportInformation).<br>
This first version was followed by a react rework which is still the latest deployed version.<br>
Currently we're working on a svelte version of the application.<br>
Contributions are welcome 🙃

### 🚇 Future

Once the svelte rework is finished and our unified backend manages data smoothly,<br>
we're looking forward to programming native versions of the app.<br>
The technology is not finally selected yet but probably will be react native,<br>
as it's supported widely with modules and has a big community.
